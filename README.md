# libreMPC (Multiple Precision Arithmetic)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **arbitrary-precision arithmetic**, also called **bignum arithmetic**, multiple-precision arithmetic, or sometimes **infinite-precision arithmetic**, indicates that [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation") are performed on numbers whose [digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit "Numerical digit") of [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_(arithmetic) "Precision (arithmetic)") are limited only by the available [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computers) "Memory (computers)") of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most [arithmetic logic unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit "Arithmetic logic unit") (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") of precision.
